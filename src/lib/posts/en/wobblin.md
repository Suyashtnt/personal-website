So in the distant past of (I think nearly exactly) a year ago,
I needed a domain for my art project (more specifically, my website _was_ my art project).
I got a free .tech domain with my GitHub student license, so I used that. Thus, tntman.tech was born.

**However,** turns out .tech domains are extremely expensive to renew (R430ish at the time of writing),
so that was just completely unfeasable to continue. So I needed one I could actually continue using.
There were a few contenders:

- tntman.dev
- suyash.dev
- wobbl.in

One of them is far funnier than the others, and thus, welcome <https://wobbl.in>!
