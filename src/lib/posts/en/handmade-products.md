## About

<Note>
This post was written for a school project. It is not meant to be taken super seriously.
The Afrikaans version will have some comments locked inside of the post itself
as part of the word count. I'm also constrained to 150 words, so R.I.P detail.
</Note>

Handmade products are quite interesting pieces of art. They are, well,
items that are made by hand, with little machinery involved.

Some examples include: Prisma Audio's AZULs, some musical instruments,
and a ton of items on [Etsy](https://etsy.com)*.

<Note>
*Etsy is a website where people can sell their handmade products.
Except its full of dropshippers and resellers so it sucks.

## Advantages

Handmade products have a few advantages over their machined counterparts.
They are higher quality. A person can spend much more
attention to detail than a machine, and some methods
of production are not possible with machines.

You also get to support individuals and small businesses.
This is a great way to support those who are still small and
not sell your soul to Amazon/Apple/Google/etc.

## Disadvantages

Handmade products are _expensive_. They take a lot of time to make,
so you will be paying for the time spent making the product. They
are also made with higher quality materials, which are more expensive.

## Conclusion

Handmade products can be a great buy sometimes. They are usually of higher quality,
and you get to support small businesses. They are expensive though,
and sometimes simply not worth it, even if you take into account
the time spent making the product.
