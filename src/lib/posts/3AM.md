I check my watch. 3AM: not a good time to be inside a pitch-black server room. It's oddly quiet. No fans whirring, lights blinking, or signs of life (although none was expected with what I was told). I sneak over to a terminal. It's shut down. I hit the power button, and it spins to life.

Oh no.
This can't be.
I wasn't told this.
It's password protected.

```
[sudo] password for server: admin
█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ 10% Downloading...
```

Poor IT guys couldn't even be bothered. I quickly open up a command prompt, trying to stay silent. This loud, clacking keyboard ain't helping either. As I'm trying to get the private logs, I hear footsteps. I turn around in a clock cycle. Nobody there. I assume they sent multiple agents down here. Log download complete.

```sh
nano /server/logs/private/2023-08-16.log
```

no. NO. _NO._ **_NOOOOOOOOO._**

I was called in by my boss for latency problems, but it's worse than that:

**_Production's down._**
